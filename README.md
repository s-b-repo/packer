    wo Operational Modes:

        generate: Creates malformed packets and saves them to a file

        test: Replays saved packets against a target

    Enhanced Features:

        Logging system for tracking operations

        Proper packet fragmentation handling

        Configurable delays and maximum packets

        Error handling and crash resistance

        Hex format storage for easy packet replay

    Testing Methodology:

bash
Copy

# 1. Generate test packets (run until you have sufficient quantity)
python fuzzer.py generate -t 192.168.1.100 -f test_packets.fuzz

# 2. Test against target system (could be a firewall, IDS, or server)
python fuzzer.py test -t 192.168.1.100 -f test_packets.fuzz -d 0.05

Network Testing Guide:

    Firewall Testing:

        Generate packets with various malformed headers

        Replay while monitoring firewall logs

        Look for crashes, memory leaks, or unexpected behavior

    IDS/IPS Testing:

        Send crafted packets to test detection capabilities

        Verify if anomaly detection systems trigger alerts

        Test evasion techniques with fragmented packets

    Protocol Stack Testing:

        Target specific services with malformed protocol implementations

        Monitor target system stability with tools like dmesg

        Check for service crashes or unexpected termination

    Performance Testing:

        Generate high volumes of packets to test processing capabilities

        Measure packet loss rates under malformed traffic loads

        Test state tracking systems with abnormal flag combinations

Analysis Tips:

    Packet Capture:

        Use Wireshark or tcpdump to capture both sent and received packets
    bash
    Copy

    tcpdump -i any -w fuzzing_test.pcap

    System Monitoring:

        Monitor target system resources during testing:
    bash
    Copy

    top -d 1 -b > system_usage.log

    Log Analysis:

        Correlate sent packets with target system logs

        Look for error messages or crash reports

        Check security device alerts and false positives

    Automated Testing:

        Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for regular testing

        Combine with monitoring tools for automated crash detection

        Use differential testing between different systems
